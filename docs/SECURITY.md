# Security

If you discover a security-related issue, please report it privately (e.g. by email to the maintainers) rather than opening a public issue. We will address it as soon as possible.

This bundle does not process user credentials or sensitive data itself; it only merges form options and translation keys. Security of your application remains your responsibility (CSRF, validation, etc.).

## Release security checklist (12.4.1)

Before tagging a release, confirm:

| Item | Notes |
|------|--------|
| **SECURITY.md** | This document is current and linked from the README where applicable. |
| **`.gitignore` and `.env`** | `.env` and local env files are ignored; no committed secrets. |
| **No secrets in repo** | No API keys, passwords, or tokens in tracked files. |
| **Recipe / Flex** | Default recipe or installer templates do not ship production secrets. |
| **Input / output** | Inputs validated; outputs escaped in Twig/templates where user-controlled. |
| **Dependencies** | `composer audit` run; issues triaged. |
| **Logging** | Logs do not print secrets, tokens, or session identifiers unnecessarily. |
| **Cryptography** | If used: keys from secure config; never hardcoded. |
| **Permissions / exposure** | Routes and admin features documented; roles configured for production. |
| **Limits / DoS** | Timeouts, size limits, rate limits where applicable. |

Record confirmation in the release PR or tag notes.
